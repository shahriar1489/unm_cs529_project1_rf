# ID3 Decision Tree Implementation
### This repository contains an implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm for constructing decision trees. The ID3 algorithm is a classic approach to decision tree learning, primarily used for classification tasks. It constructs the tree by recursively splitting the dataset based on features that provide the highest information gain. The approach in this implementation follows the description in "Machine Learning" by Tom Mitchell.

## Features
### Calculates entropy and information gain to select the best feature at each node
### Constructs a decision tree based on the training data provided
### Classifies new instances based on the generated tree structure
